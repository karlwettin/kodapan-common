Collection of small projects that I tend to use a lot.

Some of the packages and classes:

package se.kodapan.lang.reflection.augmentation
package se.kodapan.lang.reflection.augmentation.annotations
  UML class diagram syntax annotations that is mapped to a simple meta model.
  A simplification of (based on) the annotations in http://silvertejp.tigris.org/

  @BinaryAssociationEnd(aggregation = COMPOSITE,
                        otherEndName = "parent",
                        multiplicity = "0..3, 5..*",
                        qualification = String.class)
  private Map<String, Set<Child>> children;


package se.kodapan.collections
  Decorators, utilities for Map<K, Set<V>>, etc


package se.kodapan.io

  class se.kodapan.io.SerializableBean
    Bean reflection in java.io.Externalizable for backwards compatible java.io.Serializable after refactoring.
    Somewhat better than plain old java.io.Serializable but still not quite implemented,
    it needs a bunch of @Annotations and what not.

  class se.kodapan.io.GermanicInputStreamReader
    Assumes ISO8859-1 and detects UTF-8 if it's in Swedish. Should be easy to extend for more languages.


package se.kodapan.io.http
  HttpGetReader, HttpGetInputStream, etc via HttpAccessor.

  class se.kodapan.io.http.HttpAccessor
    A facade on top of Apache HttpClient 4.0
    with features such as attempting to follow redirects in HTML, javascript, etc.

  class se.kodapan.html.NekoHtmlTool
    Semi-retarded xpath replacements that allows for quick and dirty information extraction via DOM.


package se.kodapan.net

  class se.kodapan.net.URIUtil
    Resolves badly formatted URIs, gathers query parts, etc.
